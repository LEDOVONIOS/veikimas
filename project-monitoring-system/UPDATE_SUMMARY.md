# Project Monitoring System - Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. HTTP Status Code Display
- **Removed mock data generation**: The system no longer generates fake status code distributions (70.8% 2xx, 7% 3xx, etc.)
- **Shows only real monitoring data**: HTTP status codes now display actual data from monitoring your project URL
- **Added informative messages**: When no monitoring data exists, the system clearly explains that monitoring needs to be set up
- **Updated all theme files**: Changes applied to `project.php`, `project-modern.php`, and `project-dark.php`

### 2. Removed Sections
As requested, the following sections have been removed from all project view pages:
- **Cron Job Monitoring section**: No longer displays cron job status information
- **Geographic Region display**: Removed the monitoring region indicator

### 3. New Functionality
- Created `getRealStatusCodeData()` function in `includes/monitoring_functions.php` to fetch actual monitoring data
- Added request count display next to percentages in the status code summary
- Added explanatory text showing the data is based on actual monitoring of the project URL

### 4. Test Script
Created `scripts/test-real-monitoring.php` to help verify monitoring status:
- Shows current HTTP status code distribution
- Displays latest monitoring entries
- Indicates if monitoring is active or inactive
- Provides instructions for setting up monitoring

## How to Use

### Setting Up Real Monitoring
To see actual HTTP status codes for your project URL:

1. **Set up the monitoring cron job** to run every 5 minutes:
   ```bash
   */5 * * * * /usr/bin/php /path/to/project-monitoring-system/scripts/monitor_projects.php
   ```

2. **Or run monitoring manually** for testing:
   ```bash
   php /path/to/project-monitoring-system/scripts/monitor_projects.php --verbose
   ```

### What You'll See
- **With monitoring active**: Real status code percentages based on actual checks of your project URL
- **Without monitoring**: A message explaining that monitoring needs to be set up
- **Status codes are grouped**: 2xx (Success), 3xx (Redirects), 4xx (Client errors), 5xx (Server errors)

### Key Points
- The system now shows 100% accurate data from real monitoring
- No more fake/mock data that doesn't reflect your project's actual status
- Clear messaging when monitoring hasn't been set up yet
- All status codes come from actual HTTP requests to your project URL
