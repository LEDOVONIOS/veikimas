### 4. Monitors Table/List
Each monitor row displays:

- ‚ãÆ **Actions Menu**: Three-dot menu for quick actions

### 5. Sidebar Statistics

#### A. Current Status Block
- **Circular Visualization**: Dynamic donut chart showing system health
- **Statistics Display**:
  - Up monitors count (green)

### 8. Empty State

## Technical Implementation

### Database Queries
- Fetches monitor status from latest `uptime_logs` entries
- Calculates 7-day uptime for each project
- Aggregates last 24-hour statistics across all user monitors

### JavaScript Functions
- `toggleSelectAll()`: Handle bulk selection
- `filterMonitors()`: Real-time search functionality
- `sortMonitors()`: Client-side sorting without refresh
- `showActions()`: Placeholder for actions menu (currently redirects to project page)

### CSS Architecture
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Flexbox and Grid for layouts
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Mobile-first responsive approach

## Usage Notes

1. **Monitor Status Logic**:
   - Up: Last check was successful (`is_up = 1`)
   - Down: Last check failed (`is_up = 0`)
   - Paused: No monitoring data available

2. **Performance**:
   - Client-side filtering and sorting for instant response
   - Minimal database queries on page load
   - Efficient CSS animations using GPU acceleration

3. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Implement bulk actions backend
   - Add tag management system
   - Create advanced filter modal
   - Add real-time updates via WebSocket/AJAX

This modern dashboard provides a professional monitoring experience with all requested features while maintaining excellent performance and usability.
